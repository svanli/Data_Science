# Python Programming Course

This tutorial aims at providing a simple and concise introduction 
to **Python 3** programming. 

This tutorial is organised in two parts: (1) **Basic**,
tailored for anyone with no prior coding experience who is willing to learn their way through 
computer programming using the Python language; and (2) **Advanced** which dives into 
more advanced constructs in the Python language such as `classes`, `modules`, and `__magic_methods__`.

If you have programmed already in the past using other languages, we also recommend 
reading the [Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

You can use `Python 3.8` or any newer Python version with this tutorial. 
**Don't use Python 2.** 

If you write a Python 2 program now, someone will need to
convert it to Python 3 later, so it's best to just write Python 3 to
begin with. 

Python 3 code will work just fine in Python 4, so you don't
need to worry about that. Python 2 also has horrible
[Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html) issues,
so it's difficult to write Python 2 code that works correctly with characters
not originally present in the English alphabet (like π or ♫).

## Sections

### 1. Introduction

This section will introduce to the concept of computer programming, and to the 
very basics of the Python programming language:

1. [The Way of the Program](1.intro/1-the-way-of-the-program.html)
2. [Variables, Statements and Expressions](1.intro/2-variables-statements-expressions.html)
3. [Introduction to Functions](1.intro/3-intro-functions.html)
4. [Setting up an editor](1.intro/4-setup-editor.html)
5. [Conditional Statements](1.intro/5-conditionals.html)

Regardless you have already programmed before, using or not Python, 
I would suggest to take a look at this introductory section anyway. 
There is always time to **skip**, and you decide your learning pace.
